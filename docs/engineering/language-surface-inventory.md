# Language Surface Inventory

Where language-specific behavior lives today, and which 0.21 migration PR
moves each row behind the language frontend registry (`src/languages/`).
This is the working checklist for the 0.21 cycle: a row is done when its
dispatch happens through a frontend lookup and the row is checked off. Line
anchors are correct as of the PR-1 commit; expect small drift and trust the
file, not the number.

Status legend: `[ ]` not migrated · `[x]` migrated · `[-]` stays put by
design (with reason).

## Detection and identity

- [ ] `src/knowledge/packs/core.toml` — 43 `[[languages]]` profiles: id,
      name, aliases, extensions, filenames, **declared** `support` level.
      Stays the detection data source; the registry references profile ids
      (`LanguageFrontend.knowledge_ids`) instead of duplicating extensions.
      PR-9 reconciles over-declared levels (java/kotlin/csharp/c/cpp claim
      `rule-aware` today; the guard-test ledger documents the gap).
- [ ] `src/knowledge/language.rs:68` — `language_kind_from_id`: hardcoded
      id→`LanguageKind` map, duplicated against the pack. → PR-2.
- [ ] `src/audits/context/model/kinds.rs:2` — `LanguageKind` enum (43
      variants). Stays; the registry routes every variant
      (`frontend_for_kind` is exhaustive). → PR-2 consumers.

## Parse layer

- [ ] `src/analysis/parse.rs:31` — `ParseLanguage` enum (9 grammars).
- [ ] `src/analysis/parse.rs:46` — `ParseLanguage::from_label`: label-string
      → grammar map. Registry `GrammarBinding`s mirror it 1:1 today (guard
      test enforces lockstep). → PR-2 replaces with registry lookup.
- [ ] `src/analysis/parse.rs:62` — thread-local parser table. Stays, keyed
      by `ParseLanguage`; only the label dispatch moves.
- [ ] `src/scan/parsed_cache.rs`, `src/analysis/artifact.rs` — parse-once
      caches keyed by label strings. → PR-2.

## Imports and graph

- [ ] `src/graph/imports.rs:30` — `extract_imports_from`: label-string match
      dispatching to `graph/imports/{rust,ts,python,go,jvm}.rs`. → PR-3
      (`frontend().imports`).
- [ ] `src/graph/imports.rs:59` — `extract_deferred_imports_from`: same
      dispatch for Python function-body imports (0.19 cycle-breaker). → PR-3,
      byte-identical behavior.
- [ ] `src/graph/imports/{common,go,jvm,python,rust,ts,lines}.rs` — the
      per-language extractors. Already per-language (the contract's seed);
      relocate under `src/languages/*/imports.rs` with thin re-export
      adapters for one release. → PR-3.
- [-] `src/graph/resolver/`, `src/graph/v2/` — resolution and graph
      algorithms consume extracted imports; no language dispatch inside.
      Stays language-agnostic by contract (guard: no-dispatch lint, PR-7).

## Review signals

- [ ] `src/review/signals/taint/sources.rs:40` — HTTP/process input source
      patterns, one flat list covering JS/TS, Python, Go, Rust idioms. →
      PR-4 splits per frontend `ReviewTables`.
- [ ] `src/review/signals/taint/sinks.rs:60` — SQL/exec/fs/network sink
      callee tables (`subprocess`, `os.system`, `child_process.exec`,
      `exec.Command`, JDBC-style `.execute`). → PR-4.
- [ ] `src/review/signals/taint/sanitizers.rs` — parameterized-query and
      escaping tables. → PR-4.
- [ ] `src/review/signals/taint/ast.rs`, `flow.rs` — engine; must lose any
      residual label checks. → PR-4.
- [ ] `src/review/signals/behavioral/keywords.rs:21` — auth keyword
      vocabulary (strong/exact tokens, mutation verbs). Mostly
      language-neutral English identifiers; stays shared, but per-frontend
      *additions* (e.g. Spring `@PreAuthorize`) become table entries. → PR-4.
- [ ] `src/review/signals/behavioral/removed_ast.rs` — per-language AST
      queries counting auth checks / try blocks / test cases. → PR-4.
- [ ] `src/review/signals/behavioral/removed.rs:154` —
      `supports_coarse_removed_detection(ext)`: extension allowlist for the
      text fallback. → PR-4.
- [ ] `src/review/signals/classify.rs:318` — `match_node_for_boundary`:
      per-language node-kind + keyword boundary matching. → PR-4.
- [ ] `src/review/signals/algorithmic/lang.rs:13` — `function_name` and
      node-kind matchers per language label. → PR-4.

## Runtime risk and code-quality spans

- [ ] `src/audits/code_quality/language_risk.rs:68` —
      `is_ast_runtime_language(language_id)` allowlist +
      `language_risk/{js,go,python,managed}.rs` pattern modules. → PR-5
      (`frontend().risk`).
- [ ] `src/audits/code_quality/rust_panic_risk/` — Rust-only audit wired as
      its own rule family; pattern data joins the Rust frontend, severity
      calibration stays in the Knowledge Engine. → PR-5.
- [ ] `src/audits/code_quality/function_spans.rs:42` — function-node kinds
      per label (long/complex function). → PR-5.
- [ ] `src/audits/code_quality/long_function/brace.rs`,
      `complex_function/score.rs` — brace-family vs Python span logic via
      `LanguageFamily`. `LanguageFamily` (syntax shape) stays a shared
      concept; per-language node kinds move. → PR-5.

## Conventions and context

- [ ] `src/scan/path_classification.rs:34` — test-like filename conventions
      (`test_*`, `*_test`, `tests.rs`, Rust-specific carve-outs from the
      0.18 low-signal fix). → PR-6 (`frontend().conventions`).
- [ ] Test-support allowlist (`testutil.rs`, `test_utils.rs`, …) and
      `FileRole::TestSupport` wiring from the 0.19 cycle — role logic stays
      in the context classifier; the *name lists* become convention data. →
      PR-6.
- [-] `src/audits/context/classify/` — role/paradigm/runtime classification
      consumes shared context signals; stays the owner of cross-language
      context. Frontend conventions feed it; it does not move. (Declared
      `context-aware` pack levels are justified here, which is why the PR-1
      honesty ledger only covers `rule-aware` claims.)
- [ ] `src/audits/framework/` + manifest readers (`package.json`,
      `pyproject.toml`, `go.mod`, …) — framework probes per ecosystem. →
      PR-6 (probe registration), detection logic unchanged.

## Output and docs

- [ ] `docs/language-support.md` — hand-maintained tier table, already
      drifted from the pack (pack says java/kotlin/csharp/c/cpp are
      rule-aware; doc says Tier 2; the wiring says context at best). → PR-7
      generates it from the registry with a BLESS drift test.
- [-] `src/output/ai_context/repo_facts.rs`, report renderers — print
      labels/tiers; consume registry values after PR-7, no language logic of
      their own.

## Out of scope for 0.21

- `src/facts/`, `src/scan/facts.rs` — `FileFacts.language` stays a label
  string this cycle; swapping to a typed id is a 0.22+ decision after the
  consumers are registry-driven.
- MCP/SARIF surfaces — no language dispatch; they inherit whatever the
  engine emits.
